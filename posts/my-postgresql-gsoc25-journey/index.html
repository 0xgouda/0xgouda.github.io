Postgres community bonding
The first phase of GSoC is community bonding, where the mentee gets to know the community of his organization.
For Postgres, I started searching for the communication channels used by contributors, I found out about Postgres mailing lists which unfortuanetly i hadn&rsquo;t involved into it that much till now, but i also discovered the PostgreSQL Hacking Discord channel and the Hacking Workshops they host every month to study and discuss PostgreSQL topics, which has been a great resource for me since then."><meta name=author content="Ahmed Gouda"><link rel=canonical href=https://0xgouda.github.io/posts/my-postgresql-gsoc25-journey/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://0xgouda.github.io/my-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://0xgouda.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://0xgouda.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://0xgouda.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://0xgouda.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://0xgouda.github.io/posts/my-postgresql-gsoc25-journey/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://0xgouda.github.io/posts/my-postgresql-gsoc25-journey/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Ahmed's DevLog"><meta property="og:title" content="My Postgresql GSoC'25 Journey"><meta property="og:description" content=" The post will be continuously updated.
